# Welcome to AIT-DiagramCodeX

AITDiagramCodeX is a breakthrough solution from AITrailblazer that fluently converts between natural language, diagrams, and code. Utilizing state-of-the-art AI technology, DiagramCodeX serves as a link between these platforms, paving the way for a streamlined workflow for developers, engineers, and data scientists. Enter a new phase of precision and productivity with AIT DiagramCodeX.

## Our Unique User Interface

We're excited to present our MVP, which introduces a unique, three-part user interface:

- **Left Panel**: Accepts your Natural Language (NL) descriptions. Whether you're sketching a class diagram for an e-commerce platform or a state machine for a social media app, the choice is yours.
- **Middle Panel**: Employs Google's Vertex AI PaLM Text AI to convert your text descriptions into comprehensible Mermaid diagrams. This AI-powered transformation fills the gap between ideation and visual comprehension.
- **Right Panel**: A PNG image of your diagram materializes, providing an accurate, detailed visual output for better communication and easy sharing.

## Going Beyond Visualization

But, AIT-DiagramCodeX doesn't stop at visualization. Below the diagram translation, you'll see generated Go app source code, which is derived directly from your input diagram. We're not just translating, we're generating, turning intricate diagrams into ready-to-use code, thus reinventing the developer workflow.

## Built for Collaboration

Running on Google Cloud Platform's CloudRun, AIT-DiagramCodeX is constructed for collaboration. Our platform isn't just accessible; it's shareable, fostering a collaborative environment within your team.

## Our Intelligent Pipelines

The core of AIT-DiagramCodeX's advanced technology is our smart and elaborate pipeline system, structured to optimize the process from natural language to diagram and code.

### Natural Language to Diagram Pipeline

The first stage, known as the "Pipeline NL text to Diagram", initiates the translation process. This pipeline starts with your natural language input. It includes:

- **Generation Step (diagram_pantuml_gen_ai03)**: The text descriptions are taken and, using the most recent AI algorithms, are transformed to create an initial diagram representation.
- **Validation Step (diagram_pantuml_valid_ai03)**: This step validates the generated diagrams against certain parameters to confirm they accurately represent the original text input.
- **Output (diagram_pantuml_valid_ai03)**: The final, validated diagram is then outputted and presented in the user interface.

### Diagram to Code Pipeline

The following stage, the "Pipeline Diagram to Go", further transforms by turning the diagram into Go programming code. This pipeline consists of:

- **Generation Step (diagram_pantuml_go_gen_ai03)**: The diagram is assessed and then translated into corresponding Go code structure.
- **Validation Step (diagram_go_valid_ai03)**: The resultant code is validated to ensure it aligns correctly with the diagram it represents.
- **Output (diagram_go_valid_ai03)**: Eventually, the validated Go code is outputted and shown to the user.
